# Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. 
# Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

# The scope of the data is so narrow you wouldn't be able to tell which neighborhoods are popular since
# people travel very differently on major holidays. We could assume there will be no availability
# in any neighborhoods, and so the data might sugest all neighborhoods are equally popular.

# An alternative might be to analyze AirBnB price data in Amsterdam on December 24th. Higher price AirBnb rentals
# might indicate more popular areas in Amsterdam.

# Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. 
# Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

# The data will grealty vary due to the terroristic attack in NY on 9/11/01 inflicting a great deal of mental health
# trauma to a great number of New Yorkers. 

# An alternative question you could ask is "How do patterns of mental health service use vary between a city
# recently affected by a terrost attack and a city that has not?"

# Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. 
# Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?

# The data comes from mainly students, aged less than 24 and from the capital. It is too narrow in that it does
# represent all of Armenian residents throughout the country.

# You could ask, "What are the most common reasons Armenian students in the capital region visit local pubs?"
