# Possible outcomes of patterns: 2^4 = 16
# Each pattern has a 1/16 chance of occuring.

# To check, we list outcomes:
# HHHH, HHHT, HHTT, HTTT, HHTH, HTHH, HTTH, HTHT, TTTT, TTTH, TTHH, THHH, TTHT, THTT, THHT, THTH
# Each pattern in question is listed once and given equal probability of the balance coin flip, each pattern has also equal
# chance.

# P(Bernice travels by plane this year) = 10% = 0.10
# P(Plane crash) = 0.005% = 0.00005
# P(Bernice will be in a plane crash) = 0.10 * 0.00005 =  0.000005 = 0.0005%

# One can assume that the longer someone spends on the website, the higher chance they have to be
