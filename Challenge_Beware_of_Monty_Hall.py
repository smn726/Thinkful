# I was already aware and familiar with the Monty Hall Problem but I will discuss my original train
# of thought before I learned about the solution years ago.

# I first assumed the likelihood of each door having the grand prize to
# be equal or 1/3 for each door. And even after choosing a door, and being shown a dud door,
# the probability of my second choice would be a 50/50 shot, so I chose to keep my original choice.

# However, I have never been exposed to the Baye's Theorem approach to it, only a counting method that ultimately
# suggested that you had a better likelihood when switching than keeping your original choice.
